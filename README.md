Code Samples
This repository relfects a collection of programs created during my Computer Science education at Oregon State University.
Included are a small shell, an OTP Encoding program, a Text-based Adventure Game, and several smaller applications written in
C, C++, HTML5, Javascript, PHP, MySQL and more. Within each individual program folder, you'll find a README file that will
give instructions for compilation and running.

Thanks for browsing!
